description: I am a mathematics lecturer, working in both the [College of Arts, Society and Education (CASE)](https://www.jcu.edu.au/college-of-arts-society-and-education), and the [College of Science and Engineering](https://www.jcu.edu.au/college-of-science-and-engineering) at James Cook University, Bebegu Yumba campus. Before moving to JCU, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre of Australian Category Theory (CoACT)](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/innovative-technologies/centres/centre-of-australian-category-theory-coact), Macquarie University. My research is in the general area of operad theory, with a focus on modular operads and their foundations. My aim is to develop modular operadic techniques to improve our understanding of complex networks. I also have a lifelong interest in inclusive maths education. 


  I believe that (pure) mathematics can make a significant contribution in the search for enduring solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. As a working mathematician, it is my responsibility to critically examine my assumptions, practices and institutions, and work to highlight and dismantle barriers to opportunity for participation in mathematical enquiry.

      <li> I have moved! After a long wait, and some visa delays, we have arrived in Townsville, and I have started work at <a href = "https://www.jcu.edu.au/">JCU</a>. 
      <li> <a href="https://carma.newcastle.edu.au/meetings/ium/">Indigenising University Mathematics</a> conference at the University of Newcastle 20-21 September 2021. Here are my <a href="/blog/ium_reflections/">reflections</a>. (With corrections to the version included in the MQ Maths and Stats October newsletter.) </li>
      <li>My long paper on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870821004503">Graphical combinatorics and a distributive law for modular operads</a> has been published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/advances-in-mathematics/vol/392/suppl/C3">Advances in Mathematics</a>.  <!-- It can be accessed without subscription for a limited time <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1dnt0RELdnJN3">here.</a> </li> -->
      <li>The preprint of my paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04557">Brauer diagrams, modular operads and a nerve theorem for circuit algebras</a> is available on the arXiv. </li>

 <!--  My work in this area was originally motivated by multi-scale problems in neuroscience, and much of my current research is concerned with building an abstract mathematical theory of network cycles as generators of complexity. I am particularly interested in building research collaborations with the aim of translating this abstract theory into applications towards increasing the interpretability, and reducing the carbon footprint, of AI. -->
  <!--In general, I am a strong believer that pure mathematics can make a  significant contribution in the search for enduring solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. SOMETHING ABOUT ENGAGEMENT AND OBSTACLES TO OPPORTUNITY... LOOK AT CLOVER'S STATEMENT
  and to contribute to initiatives in  that could help exploring . These days, I am particularly keen to form collaborations to explore the possibilities for translating the abstract mathematical theory of networks with cycles -->
