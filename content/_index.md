description: I am a pure mathematician, currently based at the [Centre of Australian Category Theory (CoACT)](), Macquarie University. I work in the general area of operad theory, with a particular interest in the foundations of modular operads (and related structures), and applications in complex network theory.


  My work in this area was originally motivated by multi-scale problems in neuroscience, and much of my current research is concerned with building an abstract mathematical theory of network cycles as generators of complexity.  <!--I am particularly interested in building research collaborations with the aim of translating this abstract theory into applications towards increasing the interpretability, and reducing the carbon footprint, of AI. -->
  
  
  In general, I am a strong believer that pure mathematics can make a  significant contribution in the search for enduring solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. SOMETHING ABOUT ENGAGEMENT AND OBSTACLES TO OPPORTUNITY...
  
  
  and to contribute to initiatives in  that could help exploring . These days, I am particularly keen to form collaborations to explore the possibilities for translating the abstract mathematical theory of networks with cycles
