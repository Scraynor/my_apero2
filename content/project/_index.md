  description: "We live in an <em>information age</em>, and our society is increasingly shaped by complex networked data. But, it remains a major challenge to develop a general theory for analysing complex networks at multiple scales.
  
  
  <em>Operads</em> are mathematical tools for breaking up complex structures into smaller pieces and building larger systems out of smaller blacks. <em>Modular operads</em> describe systems whose components may be connected in configurations that contain cycles. The presence of cycles leads to a rich and complicated mathematical structure. 
  
  
  
  I study the formal theory of modular operads and related structures, such as <em>circuit algebras</em> (used in knot theory) and <em>compact closed categories</em>. 
  
  
  One part of my current research is to extend and generalise this theory, so that it can be applied to existing mathematical problems, for example in the study of <em> moduli spaces of curves </em>, as well as using it as a tool for translating results between different areas of mathematics, <em>toplogy, geometry</em> and <em>algebra</em> in particular. 
  
  
  Most excitingly, this provides new techniques for analysing the geometric and algebraic features of modular operads. Hence it leads to new, and broadly applicable, insights into the mathematics underlying complex networks. 



  Such fundamental work is resource cheap, but has an essential role to play in cross-disciplinary collaborations working to develop robust solutions to some of the most pressing contemporary problems, in particular around energy consumption, data and new technologies.\n"
