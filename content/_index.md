description: I am a mathematician and lecturer at James Cook University, Bebegu Yumba campus, working in the [College of Science and Engineering](https://www.jcu.edu.au/college-of-science-and-engineering). In 2022, I have also taught in the [College of Arts, Society and Education (CASE)](https://www.jcu.edu.au/college-of-arts-society-and-education) at JCU. Before moving to JCU, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre of Australian Category Theory (CoACT)](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/innovative-technologies/centres/centre-of-australian-category-theory-coact), Macquarie University. My research is in the general area of operad theory, with a focus on modular operads and their foundations. My aim is to develop modular operadic techniques to improve our understanding of complex networks. I also have a lifelong interest in inclusive maths education. 


  I believe that (pure) mathematics can make a significant contribution in the search for enduring solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. As a working mathematician, it is my responsibility to critically examine my assumptions, practices and institutions, and work to highlight and dismantle barriers to opportunity for participation in mathematical enquiry.

 <!--  My work in this area was originally motivated by multi-scale problems in neuroscience, and much of my current research is concerned with building an abstract mathematical theory of network cycles as generators of complexity. I am particularly interested in building research collaborations with the aim of translating this abstract theory into applications towards increasing the interpretability, and reducing the carbon footprint, of AI. -->
  <!--In general, I am a strong believer that pure mathematics can make a  significant contribution in the search for enduring solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. SOMETHING ABOUT ENGAGEMENT AND OBSTACLES TO OPPORTUNITY... LOOK AT CLOVER'S STATEMENT
  and to contribute to initiatives in  that could help exploring . These days, I am particularly keen to form collaborations to explore the possibilities for translating the abstract mathematical theory of networks with cycles -->
