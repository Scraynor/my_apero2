subtitle:   Brauer diagrams, modular operads, and a nerve theorem for circuit algebras (talk, 7 July)
title: Operads, Calculus, and Homotopy theory methods in Topology
abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric version of Jones's planar algebras used in the study of finite-type knot invariants. I will describe circuit algebras in terms categories of Brauer diagrams, and explain how to modify an existing nerve theorem for modular operads to obtain an analogous result for circuit algebras. Time permitting, I will also sketch how this relates to the talks by Randal-Williams and Robertson.
