Moduli spaces of algebraic curves may be composed by gluing surfaces along boundary components. At the level of homology, this composition admits a combinatorial model in terms of a PROP of (metric) <i>fat graphs</i> (or <i>ribbon graphs</i>). But, [Daniela Egas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03433) noticed that this metric fat graph composition is not strictly associative, and therefore does not describe a PROP in the category of spaces.


As part of [Women in Topology](https://awmadvance.org/research-networks/wit/), 2019, we considered explicit topological models of composition of moduli spaces, <i>up to all coherent homotopies</i>.




Our first paper focused on the genus 0 case.

<h5> Abstract: </h5>
We show that normalized cacti form an âˆž-operad in the form of a dendroidal space satisfying a weak Segal condition. To do this, we introduce a new topological operad of bracketed trees and an enrichment of the dendroidal category.

Extending this result to a modular operad of fat graphs to model higher genus curves presents a number of interesting challenges. This is the subject of current work.

, not least since it must include closed curves.  is more involved, in particular since -- unlike the admissible fat graph prop above -- %In contrast to the PROP case (\cref{proj. prop}), it is not possible to use the well-behaved model of admissible fat graphs \cite{San15}. Moreover, 
	a modular operad for surface gluing must also describe closed surfaces. As in my proof of \cref{thm: main intro}, this may be handled by representing points in the moduli space by categories of fat graphs, and not by individual graphs. %Crucially, this means it can no longer be assumed that a fat graph model describes mapping class groups of surfaces \cite{San15}.
	
	By interpreting coverings of circles by intervals into the language of fat graphs, I've constructed a modular operad for moduli spaces of (open-closed) surfaces  whose elements are categories of fat graphs -- described using classical results (related to the Birman exact sequence) -- with certain parametrisations, and whose colours are connected subspaces of $S^1$.
