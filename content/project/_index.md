  description: "It is a major challenge to develop a general theory for analysing complex networks at multiple scales. <em>Operads</em> are mathematical tools for breaking up complex structures into smaller pieces and building larger systems out of smaller blacks. <em>Modular operads</em> describe systems whose components may be connected in configurations that contain cycles. The presence of cycles makes the mathematical structure of these systems -- like <em>complex networks</em> -- notoriously difficult to describe, and has led to significant gaps in the theory.
  
  
  By making cycles the central focus of my study, I've established new combinatorial models for modular operads and related structures, such as <em>circuit algebras</em> -- used in knot theory -- and <em>compact closed categories</em> -- that have application in mathematical physics, and quantum computing (among others). One aspect of my current research is to extend and generalise this theory, and apply it to existing mathematical problems, for example in the study of <em> moduli spaces of curves </em>.
  
  
  Since it is highly abstract, this theory also provides a tool for translating results between different areas of mathematics, <em>toplogy, geometry</em> and <em>algebra</em> in particular. This, in turn, provides new techniques for studying the geometric and algebraic features of modular operads. 
  
  
  We live in an <em>information society</em> (increasingly) built on complex networks. For me, the most exciting aspect of my work is that it seeks to understand the most fundamental abstract properties of these very structures. Abstract mathematical theories of complex networks provide a broadly applicable basis for new tools that can be used, for example, to improve the transparency of machine learning. 
  
  
  Such fundamental work is resource cheap, but has an essential role to play in cross-disciplinary collaborations working to develop robust solutions to some of the most pressing contemporary problems, in particular around energy consumption, data and new technologies.\n"
