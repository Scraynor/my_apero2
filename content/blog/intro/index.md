  Welcome to my new website! It is intended as a repository for filing some of the research notes that have been piling up over the years, as well as a (reasonable real-time) record of events, experiences and emotions around maths research, teaching and learning, and culture. 
  
  
  As well as filling in more details on my research, a couple of important elements are 'in planning' and still missing from the first version of the site. First, there will be a section on <i>learning (and teaching)</i>. Second, I hope to use this site to lend my voice to conversations highlighting the experiences of wonder, solace, pain, exclusion, and everything in between, that are part of the activity of mathematics. <i>Why</i>? Because humanising our discipline is a way to reflect on its value, and our responsibilities, and to tackle some of the obstructions to participation and progress.
  
  
  Personally, I have been so grateful in the past couple of years to finally hear some of these conversations happening in public spaces: see, for example, <i>'nice maths Twitter'</i>, as well as [ATSIMA](atsima.com), [Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Science](https://minoritymath.org/) and their wonderful [Mathematically Uncensored podcast](https://minoritymath.org/mathematically-uncensored/), and the [Inclusion /Exclusion blog](https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/). 
  
  So, one of the first things I will need to do is share a little more about my own trajectory, which I know would have been very different if these resources had been around when I was a student.
