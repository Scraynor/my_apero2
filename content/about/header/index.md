Mathematician, PhD Aberdeen 2018, she/her. 

  
Currently based at Macquarie University, Darug Country, Australia. I acknowledge the traditional custodians of the Macquarie University Land, the Wattamattageal clan of the Darug nation, 
whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue to nurture this land. I pay my respects to Elders past, present and future.
